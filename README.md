1. INTRODUCTION

- A main objective

According to recent scientific studies, Professor William James of Harvard used to say “the average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.” A few can be used more than that number by practicing themselves with various brain activities like computer playing games. Like the athletes' muscles, human’s neurons will gradually disappear if they are sedentary. Therefore, people find a game as a way to maintain the brain’s movement. One of the most effective games to train the memory is that remember the appearing numbers and trying to write them as much as possible. Therefore, the objective of this game program is to help players maintain the memory operation through the game's level requirements.

- A reward for fulfilling the objective

Players will be requested to register their names to record and compare their highest score achieved with the previous competitors.
    In the ranking table, there are 5 levels corresponding to 5 stars:
      - 1 star: complete 5 levels;
      - 2 stars: complete 10 levels;
      - 3 stars: complete 15 levels;
      - 4 stars: complete 20 levels;
      - 5 stars: complete 25 levels;
      - MASTER: complete 30 levels.

In addition, the player will also receive an analysis which give advice to exercise the brain efficiently.

- A consequence for failing the objective.

As mentioned above, there will be no losers. This game aims to train the memory. Each player has 3 lives for a single turn. If all 3 networks are out, players will receive an analysis of brain activities along with some tips for training brain more effectively.

- A challenge for the player(s)

Every player must try to remember the numbers (characters) that appear randomly in 5 columns within 3 seconds and then they will be covered. After that time, the player must fill in the final line of the columns with the exact numbers (characters) which appeared in samecolumn in order from left to right in descending time (for example, 30 seconds for level 1 and only 25 seconds left for level 3 ...). If it is wrong in a column, the player will lose one life and will be asked to play that level again with a few percentage points deducted.

By level 10, players will face characters a through z. And to level 20 onwards is both the number and the letter both uppercase and lowercase.


2. Why choose this game?

The simple game that helps players to both practice memory and is not under pressure to keep up the game is one of the recent game development trends. By developing a simple game that can apply as much as possible the tricks in C ++, it will be highly useful for training the skills of the developer.

3. How to play this game?
